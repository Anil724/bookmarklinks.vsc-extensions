    <p>India is looking at further strengthening the pact on services with Australia in the proposed compressive economic cooperation trade agreement (CECA) to boost the sector's exports, an official said on Thursday.

        The two countries have already implemented an interim trade agreement in goods and services in December 2022 and are now under negotiations to expand its scope through CECA.
        
        The next round of talks is expected in December here.
        
        "One of the areas of interest for India is to strengthen our agreement on the services side because our services exports are doing good. So whatever we feel can be done more where India can actually improve our exports, we are looking at those areas and trying to see what else can be done," the official said.
        
         
        The estimated value of service exports during April-September 2024 is $ 180 billion as compared to $ 163.92 billion in April-September 2023. In 2023-24, it was over $ 340 billion.
        
        India is also interested in government procurement, but the country has some sensitivities in its government procurement.</p>
